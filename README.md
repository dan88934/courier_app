# courier_app

This application receives orders and calculates the cost of insurance for the customers of a fictional courier company.

The application allows users to add orders to the database by filling in a form. Users are then given
an order reference number. They can use this number to search for their order and see details about it
on the search page.

There are frontend and backend tests included, utilizing Selenium and Unittest. These can be ran from 
the main directory with 'python -m unittest'.
